The South Rupununi (hereafter ‘the Rupununi’) is surrounded by the Pakaraima Mountain range to the north, the Marudi Mountains to the southeast and a continuous savannah habitat that extends into Roraima, Brazil.","Results":"Camera trap surveys were conducted between February and October 2024 in Awarewaunau, Maruranau and Shea in Region 9, Guyana. We studied each community during the dry (February-April) and wet (May-November) seasons. \nOver the eight (8) months, we saw seventeen (17)  of the twenty-four (24) different animals seen during this study, including large animals that are popularly hunted species, such as the deer, the tapir and labba, two of the six wildcats (jaguarundi and ocelot) and a very rare wild dog (bush dog) in Guyana. They are very important animals that help keep the environment healthy. ","Conclusion":"Monitoring and research activities provide very important information that can be used to understand the status of the environment, how animals use and behave in the environment, and guide decision-making in land management in Awarewaunau. Awarewaunau's community-led monitoring has resulted in updated Village Plans with guidelines for land management, including a community conservation area for giant anteaters and giant armadillos over their entire titled land area"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-59.0816,2.6597]}}]}
